# Real World Asset Platform (RWAx)

A decentralized platform on Starknet that enables users to fractionally own, trade, and invest in real-world assets 
(RWAs) such as real estate, art, and commodities using blockchain technology. 

Some of the Existing Problems in real world assets includes
- High Entry Barriers: Traditional asset ownership requires significant capital.
- Liquidity Issues: Selling RWAs is slow and complex.
- Lack of Transparency: Ownership records are centralized and prone to manipulation.
- Complex legal structures create friction and overhead costs
- Limited price discovery due to infrequent sales
- Geographical and jurisdictional limitations on ownership

RWAx offers solutions to address these problems by naking: 
- Fractional Ownership: RWAs are tokenized into small, tradable units.
- Instant Liquidity: Users can buy/sell asset fractions in a decentralized marketplace.
- Blockchain Transparency: Ownership and transactions are securely recorded on Starknet.
- Transfer Protocol: Efficient settlement of fractional ownership transactions
- Pricing Oracle: Fair market valuation for fractional units
- Liquidity Pools: Automated market making for fractional shares

Target Users are: 
- Retail Investors: Individuals looking to invest in RWAs with small capital.
- Property Owners: Those who want to tokenize and sell portions of their assets.
- DeFi Enthusiasts: Users interested in yield-bearing RWAs.

Currently RWAx is pioneering fractional 
ownership in the Starknet ecosystem.
