# Real World Asset Platform (RWAx)

A decentralized platform on Starknet that enables users to fractionally own, trade, and invest in real-world assets 
(RWAs) such as real estate, art, and commodities using blockchain technology. 

Some of the Existing Problems in real world assets includes
- High Entry Barriers: Traditional asset ownership requires significant capital.
- Liquidity Issues: Selling RWAs is slow and complex.
- Lack of Transparency: Ownership records are centralized and prone to manipulation.
- Complex legal structures create friction and overhead costs
- Limited price discovery due to infrequent sales
- Geographical and jurisdictional limitations on ownership

RWAx offers solutions to address these problems by naking: 
- Fractional Ownership: RWAs are tokenized into small, tradable units.
- Instant Liquidity: Users can buy/sell asset fractions in a decentralized marketplace.
- Blockchain Transparency: Ownership and transactions are securely recorded on Starknet.
- Transfer Protocol: Efficient settlement of fractional ownership transactions
- Pricing Oracle: Fair market valuation for fractional units
- Liquidity Pools: Automated market making for fractional shares

Target Users are: 
- Retail Investors: Individuals looking to invest in RWAs with small capital.
- Property Owners: Those who want to tokenize and sell portions of their assets.
- DeFi Enthusiasts: Users interested in yield-bearing RWAs.

Currently RWAx is pioneering fractional ownership in the Starknet ecosystem. 

# Technical Architecture

| Component                    | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RWA Token Factory**        | Smart contract to tokenize real-world assets as ERC-721/ERC-1155 or ERC-20 wrapped fractional units. |
| **Fractionalization Module** | Allows splitting of asset tokens into fungible units for shared ownership.                           |
| **Marketplace Protocol**     | Decentralized exchange for listing and trading fractionalized assets.                                |
| **Transfer Protocol**        | Starknet-native, optimized protocol for seamless asset transfer.                                     |
| **Valuation Oracle**         | Oracle that feeds in external pricing data from Chainlink + DEX TWAPs.                               |
| **Liquidity Pools**          | AMM-based pools that enable swapping and liquidity provision for fractional tokens.                  |
| **Access Control Layer**     | RBAC or NFT gating to handle permissions (e.g. only verified tokenizers can mint).                   |

# Technology Stack

- Starknet (Cairo) – ZK-rollup scalability and cost-efficiency.
- Foundry – Smart contract development and testing.
- Chainlink – Real-world price feeds.
- IPFS/Filecoin – Asset documentation and legal proof storage.
- The Graph – Indexing for on-chain queries.

# How It Works

- Asset Tokenization: A verified asset owner uploads documents and tokenizes their asset.
- Fractionalization: The token is split into ERC-20 fractions representing ownership shares.
- Marketplace Listing: These tokens can be listed in the RWAx DEX or paired with stablecoins for liquidity.
- Investor Interaction: Users purchase fractions, gaining exposure to the asset.
- Price Updates: Pricing oracle ensures real-world valuation is reflected on-chain.
- Ownership Transfers: When sold, ownership fractions are updated and verified via the Starknet transfer protocol.
